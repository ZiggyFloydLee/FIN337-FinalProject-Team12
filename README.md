# FIN 337: Team 12 Final Project Repo
## By: Kevin Chen, Ziggy Lee, Ryan Thomas, Jinyi Xu

This repository contains the full final project for FIN 377: Data Science for Finance.

In our project, we aim to look at the IPO market observing traditional IPOs and SPAC mergers. We analyze data from [Jay R. Ritter PhD](https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/) (University of Florida), [SPACInsider.com](https://www.spacinsider.com/), [wrds](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/), stock market data, and SEC Filings(Form S-1 and Form 425). 

## Research Question

1. Broad Question:
Our project focuses on the overall effectiveness and efficiency of different methods for companies to access public capital markets. Specifically, the debate might focus on understanding which method of going public provides the best long-term value for companies and investors, considering the recent surge in popularity of SPACs relative to the traditional IPO route.

Specific Research Question:
- Performance Comparison: How do the long-term financial performances of companies that go public via SPACs compare to those that conduct traditional IPOs?
- Cost Analysis: What are the total costs associated with going public through a SPAC versus an IPO?

2. Hypothesis
Hypothesis: The total cost of going public via a SPAC is lower when measured immediately post-IPO but higher when considering long-term performance metrics.

3. Prediction Metrics
Metrics of Success: The primary metric of success could be the long-term stock price performance. Secondary metrics might include market capitalization growth, and financial health metrics such as EBITDA growth, or debt-to-equity ratios.
Baseline for Comparison: Historical averages of post-IPO performance for both SPACs and IPOs as a baseline.
